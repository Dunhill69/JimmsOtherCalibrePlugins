# JimmsOtherCalibrePlugins

FYI, [EpubMerge](https://github.com/JimmXinu/EpubMerge), [EpubSplit](https://github.com/JimmXinu/EpubSplit) and [SmartEject](https://github.com/JimmXinu/SmartEject) each have their own repositories now.  And FFDL has become [FanFicFare](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare).

This is a repository for me to keep my 'other' calibre plugins, IE, not
FFDL, EpubMerge, EpubSplit and SmartEject.

You're welcome to try using these, but I'm not going to offer very much support.

## Other People's Plugins

ViewManager, FavouritesMenu, etc

Sometimes plugins need work to be brought up to date.  I'm also
throwing those that I work on here to benefit from versioning.  I
don't necessarily promise to maintain them beyond my own use.
