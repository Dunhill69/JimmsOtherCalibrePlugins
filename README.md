# JimmsOtherCalibrePlugins

FYI, [EpubMerge](https://github.com/JimmXinu/EpubMerge), [EpubSplit](https://github.com/JimmXinu/EpubSplit) and [SmartEject](https://github.com/JimmXinu/SmartEject) each have their own repositories now.  And FFDL has become [FanFicFare](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare).

This is a repository for me to keep my 'other' calibre plugins, IE, not
FFDL, EpubMerge, EpubSplit and SmartEject.

You're welcome to try using these, but I'm not going to offer very much support.
